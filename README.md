# nosql_challenge


In the nosql_setup_starter first we imported data in 'establishments.json' using the Terminal, next we update out Database to account for a new restaurant with associated data.  We then check out the data to remove any establisments within the Dover Local Authority from the Database, and check number of documents to esure deletion.  Lastly, we convert the string values to decimal values for the numerical values.


In the nosql_analysis_starter we find various queries based on different questions we want answered.  

Questions include:

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
